-- Server-side aggregation for the cross-device account view.
--
-- Motivation: each tokentracker-account-* edge function used to fetch raw
-- tokentracker_hourly rows in 1000-row PostgREST pages and aggregate them in
-- the edge. Measured cost is ~300-600ms PER 1000-row page (PostgREST round-trip
-- + JSON serialization of 1000 rows), NOT the DB scan (which is ~7ms, indexed).
-- A heavy user's 52-week heatmap spanned ~7 pages (~3.2s) and every other
-- account-* function re-paginated its own range on top of that.
--
-- This function does the GROUP BY in Postgres and returns a SINGLE jsonb row
-- (jsonb_agg), which sidesteps PostgREST's 1000-row response cap entirely: one
-- round-trip, no pagination. The heaviest real user's 52-week heatmap dropped
-- from ~3.2s to ~137ms server-side. tz-local bucketing uses `AT TIME ZONE`
-- (same IANA tz database as the old JS Intl.DateTimeFormat path, including DST
-- — verified against the old functions across Asia/Shanghai, America/New_York
-- spanning a spring-forward, and a fixed UTC offset).
--
-- CROSS-DEVICE SEMANTIC (GitHub Discussion #101) — two source classes:
--   * MACHINE-LEVEL sources (claude/codex/gemini/...) come from each machine's
--     LOCAL logs. Two real machines do independent work, so they must add up:
--     SUM across the user's ACTIVE devices.
--   * ACCOUNT-LEVEL sources (cursor) come from a per-ACCOUNT cloud API, NOT
--     machine logs. Every device that syncs them stores an IDENTICAL copy, so
--     SUMming across devices multiplies one account's usage by its device
--     count (the v0.42.0 bug: a 2-machine user's Cursor total was double). For
--     these, pick ONE canonical row per (hour, source, model) across ALL the
--     user's devices — dedup, do not add.
-- The account-level source list MUST stay in sync with ACCOUNT_LEVEL_SOURCES in
-- src/lib/source-metadata.js (parity asserted by test/account-source-parity.test.js).
--
-- Whole-row (not per-column MAX) canonical pick: a per-column MAX would synth a
-- row that never existed and inflate cost, which is derived from the individual
-- token columns (src/lib/pricing computeRowCost), not total_tokens. DISTINCT ON
-- keeps the columns of one real row internally consistent.
--
-- Hour-grain dedup BEFORE tz bucketing: account-level data is per-hour, so the
-- canonical pick happens at the raw hour_start grain; only then is it truncated
-- to the tz-local hour/day/month. Deduping at a coarser (e.g. daily) bucket
-- would collapse many real hours into one and under-count.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER (the default): runs with the caller's privileges, so it
-- never exposes more than a direct SELECT on tokentracker_hourly would. The
-- edge functions call it with the service-role token AFTER verifying the user's
-- JWT and resolving p_user_id / p_device_ids server-side.
--
-- Determinism (Codex review): jsonb_agg is ordered by (bucket, source, model)
-- so the array — and therefore the model-breakdown `sources` ordering and the
-- per-bucket `models` object key order built in the edge — is stable across
-- query plans, mirroring the old `.order("hour_start")` behavior.
--
-- Invalid timezone (Codex review): an unrecognized p_tz would make
-- `AT TIME ZONE p_tz` raise and 500 the endpoint. The old JS caught the
-- Intl.DateTimeFormat throw and fell back to the offset. The tzr CTE validates
-- p_tz against pg_timezone_names once; an unknown zone falls back to
-- p_offset_min, then UTC — matching the old precedence.
--
-- p_trunc: 'hour' | 'day' | 'month' | 'none' (none = group by source+model only)
-- p_tz:    IANA zone (e.g. 'Asia/Shanghai') or NULL
-- p_offset_min: fallback minutes east of UTC when p_tz is NULL/invalid (monthly
--               passes both NULL to bucket by UTC, matching the old slice).
--
-- Idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE). Rollback: DROP FUNCTION account_usage_grouped.
